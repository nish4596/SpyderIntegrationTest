# SpyderIntegrationTest
I'm creating this repo to test how the spyder-git integration works.


Commands and steps.
1. Create a repo in github.
2. Open git bash in your local system.
3. pwd - to see the current working directory.
4. cd /c/....... - to change the current directory.
5. git init - to start a new project in your local system.
6. git remote add origin "URL" - to add the origin in your local system.
7. git add "new file name" - to track the newly added file. (git add -A for multiple files)
8. git commit -m "Message" - to commit/save. (git commit -a -m "message" - for multiple files)
9. git push -u origin master - to push the changes to the remote/centre.
10. git checkout master - to change between branches. (Always be switch to master branch and merge others to it)
11. ls - list of files in the directory.
12. cat TestingCode.py - to view the file.
13. git remote -v - To check the current remote.
    Output :  origin  https://github.com/nish4596/SpyderIntegrationTest.git (fetch)
