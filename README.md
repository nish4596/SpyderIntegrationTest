# SpyderIntegrationTest
I'm creating this repo to test how the spyder-git integration works.


Commands and steps.
1. Create a repo in github.
2. Open git bash in your local system.
3. pwd - to see the current working directory.
4. cd /c/....... - to change the current directory.
5. git init - to start a new project in your local system.
6. git remote add origin "URL" - to add the origin in your local system.
